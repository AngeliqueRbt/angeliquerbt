### Evolution of my project
My interest in translation started in middle shcool. Passionate about literature, I wanted, at that time, to become a literary and tourism translator. In high school, when I started to watch more films, series, documentaries, it was audiovisual translation that started to gain my interest. A few years later, `audiovisual and tourism translation` are still the fields in which I would like to specialize, but to this is added `translation in the field of international press and marketing`.

##### Personal goals
It is known that to better know and dominate a language, it is necessary to practice it regularly but also to immerse yourself in it. This is why, in addition to the fact that I like to travel, I plan to visit several countries on all continents once my Master's degree has been validated.

As of today I have only visited several French and Spanish cities/regions/municipalities including:
* France
    - Rocamadour
    - Paris
    - Chenonceau
    - Archachon
* Spain
    - Córdoba
    - Seville 
    - Madrid
    - Granada

Once my master is validated, I would like to visit:  
* Europe
    * The Netherlands
    * Sueden
    * Danish Realm
    * Norway
* Asia
    * South Korea
    * Japan
    * Thailand
    * Vietnam
* America
    * Canada
    * Peru
    * United States
    * Cuba

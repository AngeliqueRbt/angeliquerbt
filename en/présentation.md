### **About me**

I am currently a second year student in a Master's degree program in writing and translation at the Université Occidental de Brest. As I already wanted to become a translator in middle school, I took, in high school, literary studies with a Portuguese LV3 as a speciality, as I have always liked learning languages. These Portuguese classes, where we translated simple dialogues from the 10th grade on, confirmed my interest for translation.
Moreover, as part of the construction of our professional project in the first year of high school, I also made a group video about the translator's job for the educational video contest *I Film the Job I Like*, ~~an experience that also made me realize that I had no future as an actress~~, which ended up in the jury's selection!
